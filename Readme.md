    $ npm install toolbelt

## Running Tests

To run the tests first invoke the following command to install all dev dependencies.

    $ npm install

Run the tests with
 
    $ npm test

## Modules

### Basic usage

Load and use a module:

    var helper = require('toolbelt').pick([module_namespace]);
    var data = helper([do_your_thing]);

### Module: base/extend

Merge the contents of two or more objects/arrays together into the first object/array.    

    extend([deepCopy,] target [, object1] [, objectN] );

* **deepCopy** A Boolean that if true enables deepcopy.
* **target** An object that will receive the new properties.
* **object1** An object containing additional properties to merge in.
* **object2** Additional objects containing properties to merge in.

#### Examples:

**Shallow extend**

    var extend = require('toolbelt').pick('base/extend');
    var data = extend({a:1},{b:2});

**Deep extend**

    var extend = require('toolbelt').pick('base/extend');
    var data = extend(true,{a:1},{b:2});

### Module: base/has

A extend version of "hasOwnProperty" tests if a object has a certain structure.

    has(object, path);

* **object** A object to check.
* **path** A path of keys to test against the object.

#### Examples:

    var has = require('toolbelt').pick('base/has');
    var data = {foo:{bar:{baz:1}}};
    var hasPath = has(data,'foo.bar.baz'); // returns true
    var hasPath = has(data,'foo.bar.nuv'); // returns false
